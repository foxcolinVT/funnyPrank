This is a ducky script that changes the windows insert media sound to something that is not the windows insert media sound

I made the .wav file that the script downloads intentionally not follow the conventional windows sound naming scheme in order to have it easily deleted from the windows media library
This script can easily be modified to overwrite the standard windows insert .wav file if you are more malicious
